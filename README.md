# Welcome to Py-Aids.
Py - Aids is a custom made Package superset for ease of access regarding information on every coexistent Python Module. This is still in development, so expect a whole lot of new additions.
## This Super Package enables you to have a glance at almost all python specific modules, and how to use them with examples.

### The Package aims to provide information on Advanced Data Structures, namely of three types: 

- Linear
- Non Linear
- Hash Based

Here is a brief overview of these Three.

## <u>Linear Data Types</u>
Data structures where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent is called a **linear data structure**. In linear data structure. Here are some examples:

- [Arrays Datastructure](https://github.com/Quarkblue/Py-AIDS/tree/main/PyAids/lds/Arrays)
- [Lists Datastructure](https://github.com/Quarkblue/Py-AIDS/tree/main/PyAids/lds/Lists)
