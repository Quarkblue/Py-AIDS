# Welcome to Py-Aids.
Py - Aids is a custom made, user created module superset for ease of access regarding information on every coexistent Python Module. This is still in development, so expect a whole lot of new additions.
## This Super Module enables you to have a glance at almost all python specific modules, and how to use them with examples.

### The Module aims to provide information on Advanced Data Structures, namely of three types: 

- Linear
- Non Linear
- Hash Based

Here is a brief overview of these Three.

## <u>Linear Data Types</u>
Data structures where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent is called a **linear data structure**. In linear data structure. Here are some examples:

- Arrays
- Lists
- Circular Buffers

And many more.

## <u>Non Linear Data Types </u>
A non linear Data structire is a form of data structure where the data elements don't stay arranged linearly or sequentially. Some examples of these are:

- Trees
- Graphs

In the tree data structure, it contains a hierarchical relationship; While a graph is a non-linear data structure with a finite number of vertices and edges, and these edges are used to connect the vertices.

## <u>Hash Based Data Types </u>
Hashing in the data structure is a technique of mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function. It is also known as the message digest function. It is a technique that uniquely identifies a specific item from a collection of similar items. There are specific data types regarding this methodology, namely:

- Bloom Filter 
- Binary Fuse Filter

And many more.

With this, we come to an end of the initial onboarding guide of this Venture. Proceed into further guides with the name *README.md* within folders like lds, to know more information about module specific commands.
